THE FRUSTRATION WAS HIGH BECAUSE OF AN ACCORDION! I learned a lot from this project, and how the nitty gritty of Bootstrap is actually pretty easy to figure if you take the time to figure it out. You realise how much work is put into building these frameworks and you gain a newfound respect for the people that make these. The convenience? I appreciate it a lot more. I also felt like a kid breaking up the house computer just to put it back together again to figure out how it worked. So much fun. And now, I can build a real portfolio. Note to self: *take walks, but don't, i repeat, DO NOT, give up on it. Keep at it*.
