My favourite thing to do is hang out with my wonderful dog, Jazz, on some afternoons, just before sunset. I have three fish as well: Alpha, Beta and Katara.

          What got you into photography and make up?
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="flush-collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
        <div class="accordion-body text">Those deserve two separate answers. I liked the idea of photography because often, when I watched my all time favourite movie as a kid (s/o to the green ogre and talking donkey, MVP's for real), I would often pause on moments that I wanted to look at for a little longer. And so often I try to do that with a lot of things, as I am the biggest sentimentalist I know: I hold moments like that very near and dear to me. I loved having those moments frozen in black and white, because there's such a timelesssness to it. As for make up, that too stems from childhood exposure. My mother was (a great many things, but) a make-up artist for various events, and so there was always make-up lying around in the house. I have an estranged relationship with make-up, but I love the idea that for a short period of time, I can create a character and bring it into my reality. Make-up makes that translation easier. Combine the two together, and you have moments that I freeze in timelessness, and it's a moment of when I was playing a certain character. It's a healing process, I think. It's fun too. It reminds me to take things less serriously.</div>

          Okay, scenario: Money is no object. What is your first purchase?
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="flush-collapseTwo" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
        <div class="accordion-body text">Huh. Probably something for those closest to me. I often feel bad that I don't have the means to do certain things for them, so I'd probably be so grateful to be rich that I'd get something for all of them. But if the money gets to my head, I'm taking myself on holiday to the coast. There's nothing more I want in this life than a quiet time away from everything and to spend all of that time with the sea in my backyard. I love being near the sea, being in the water. It's the best time for me. But whichever happens first, I'm definitely saving some of it away. Saving is non-negotiable.</div>

          Dead or alive: who would like to sit and have tea with?

      </h2>
      <div id="flush-collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionFlushExample">
        <div class="accordion-body text">Hmm. Maya Angelou is one. I would love to get into her head about some things, hear some stories. I think she would have the best jokes for some reason, and I love sitting and talking to people that are open to the flow of conversation. Tyler, the Creator would be another, but it probably wouldn't be tea. I just want to be around him for a day, and witness his humanity in my reality. I think he's the most passionate human being, and his means of creation are so boundless, just spending a couple hours around him and watching him do his thing would give me some perspective. So if it means sitting in a corner while he's in studio or we're biking around whichever neighbourhood, I'd happily do that. And the last one would probably be... Jessie Reyez. Definitely Jessie Reyez. I don't even know where to begin with her, she's so incredible. I wish I could soak up all the wisdom she has and learn from her, not that I don't already. Again, the perspective thing, being around her would open a side of life I'm not aware of. That's three people, my bad.</div>

        <div class="accordion-body text">Whew! I- wow. What an experience that was, uhm. I guess, I can thank my high school experience for the people I came across during my time there. The saying "people come into your life for a reason or a season" rings in my head when I think about it. Some people I've made long time friends with, others I've learned important lessons about identity, relationships and having a compass in life. There are things that I reflect on and most of them come from my high school experience. The biggest takeaways are that people have been people, are people, and will always be people, and that if it's meant for you, it will never lose you because it is yours. The rest makes me shudders because I do not understand why I had to wear such a thick layer of black eyeliner.</div>
